Hi, I’m Priyanshu Tomer. I’m from Rohtak, a small town in Haryana, and I’ve been working at Oracle Cerner for nearly 4 years. 
My roles and responsibilities include projects such as OS migrations in DC and GCP, host provisioning, Kubernetes cluster setup and patching, and load balancing. I’ve also automated IAM resource provisioning using Terraform and configured log routing.
I have worked on optimising cloud costs by Decommissioning unused resources, right-sizing compute instances & optimising storage.
 
Before this , I have also worked on Linux patching, vulnerability management, and database maintenance using SQL*Plus. I also led a change management team, auditing change requests through BMC Remedy.
 
On the personal side, I come from a defence background, which has made me confident in my ability to communicate and collaborate effectively, boosting both productivity and quality. One weakness I’ve identified is that I sometimes find it hard to say no when people ask for help, which occasionally puts me in a tough spot.
 
My hobbies include playing outdoor sports like cricket and football, going on bike rides, and being the occasional chef at home. That’s pretty much about me—I’m happy to answer any questions you have.
