Currently working as part of AGILE methodology, tracking everything on JIA, except ahoc production requests, use XMatters for it
manage infrastructure and configurations using terraform and ansible
delivers apps as containers on kubernetes
monitor the pods and infrastructure



1)	ApigeeX
	Apigee X is Google Cloud's API management platform that allows organizations to develop, manage, secure, and scale APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
	Itâ€™s the next generation of Apigee, tightly integrated with Google Cloud services
	
	
2)	Provisioned GCP and Azure hosts
		we used the Azure Portal / Google Cloud Console
		Gcloud / az CLI 
		
		Together using Terraform Modules
		
		code :
			# For GCP
				provider "google" {
				project = "my-project-id"
				region  = "us-central1"
				}
	
				resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
				name         = "gcp-instance"
				machine_type = "e2-medium"
				zone         = "us-central1-a"
				...
				}
				
				# For Azure
				provider "azurerm" {
				features = {}
				}
				
				resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" {
				name                = "azure-vm"
				resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
				location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
				...
				}
	
3)	Managing Kubernetes Cluster Setup
	Managing Kubernetes clusters, whether on GCP (GKE) or Azure (AKS), involves PROVISIONING THE CLUSTER, configuring access, deploying workloads, and setting up monitoring and scaling.
	
	Step 1 : Provisioning the Cluster
			create a resource group
			create a cluster
			connect the resource group to the cluster
	
	Step 2 : Cluster Configuration Management Tasks
			Kubeconfig: Use ~/.kube/config to authenticate and access clusters.
			RBAC
			Network Policies : restrict communication between pods
			Resource Quotas and limits
	
	Step 3 : Deployment and Scaling
			Kubectl or gitOPS tool like ARGOCD
			kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
			
			enable horizontal pod autocaling
			kubectl autoscale deployment myapp --cpu-percent=80 --min=2 --max=10
